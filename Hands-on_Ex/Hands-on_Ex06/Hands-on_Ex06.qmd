# 6.1 Overview

In this hands-on exercise, we will learn how to compute Global Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (GMSA) by using **spdep** package. By the end to this hands-on exercise, we will be able to:

-   import geospatial data using appropriate function(s) of **sf** package,

-   import csv file using appropriate function of **readr** package,

-   perform relational join using appropriate join function of **dplyr** package,

-   compute Global Spatial Autocorrelation (GSA) statistics by using appropriate functions of **spdep** package,

    -   plot Moran scatterplot,

    -   compute and plot spatial correlogram using appropriate function of **spdep** package.

-   provide statistically correct interpretation of GSA statistics.

Also, we will learn how to compute Local Measures of Spatial Autocorrelation (LMSA). By the end to this hands-on exercise, we will be able to:

-   compute Local Indicator of Spatial Association (LISA) statistics for detecting clusters and outliers by using appropriate functions **spdep** package;

-   compute Getis-Ordâ€™s Gi-statistics for detecting hot spot or/and cold spot area by using appropriate functions of **spdep** package; and

-   to visualise the analysis output by using **tmap** package.
